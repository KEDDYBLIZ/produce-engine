;; harvest-tracker
;; 
;; This contract serves as the central hub for the Produce Engine ecosystem, handling all aspects of 
;; agricultural produce tracking, verification, and incentive distribution. It maintains records of 
;; harvest data, calculates appropriate rewards based on quality and yield, and manages a token 
;; economy that incentivizes sustainable farming practices.
